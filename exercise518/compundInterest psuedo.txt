convert the principal from dollars to cents(multiply by 100)

declare the rate as a double and initialise to zero
set variables principal, time and rate
calculate the rate and multiply with the principal
create a for loop
calculate the amount and find modulo 100 to get cents
then divide by 100 to get the dollars
print the dollars and cents with a dot sign in the middle
