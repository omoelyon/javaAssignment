algorithm for sorting a ten element array
=> take the first element of the array and compare with all the other elements of the array
=> if it is lesser than all the others, put in a new array (ordered)
=> if it is not lesser, put the lesser integer into the new array (ordered)
=> when one of the numbers if populated into the ordered, it would be deleted from the unordered array
=> repeat the steps above till the unordered array is empty
=> the break the loop
